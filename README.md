Fork of https://bitbucket.org/mpcdev/digest2.git

* It is not intended to be used outside the Pan-STARRS project
* Based on digest2:0.19.2 (git clone + git branch v0.19.2)

Differences with digest2:
* Force default noheadings to 0 (i.e. no headings)
* Prepend a '#' in front of the "comments" (like '.... lines skipped')
